### Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering (in Go)

To quote wikipedia, "this is used for making recommendations". 

This uses a neighest-neighbor based algorithm to compare a users product selection with other users. Most of the time cosine similarity or correlation similarity is used for the explicit case, and jaccard similarity is used for the implicit case.

Not a complete product a.t.m
