### Go Recommend

Collaborative Filtering (CF) is oftentimes used for item recommendations for users, and many libraries exist for other languages (popular implementations include Mahout, Prediction.IO, etc..). While many approaches to collaborative filtering and recommendation build off user similarity (either through cosine similarity or correlation similarity), there are also several algorithms that are more complex. As there are very few machine learning packages out there for [G](http://www.golang.org), I decided to put together some CF algorithms that I thought were interesting. Programming in Go has many benefits - namely speed/efficiency, but also the bare-bones nature allows for more customization and makes ML programming less black-box-y. 

### Incorporated Collaborative Filters

Most of the recommendation algorithms to date are outlined in [this article](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/aai/2009/421425/)

- Simple Bayesian CF Algorithm
- Alternating Least Squares and Weighted Alternating Least Squares
- Hopefully more to come!
